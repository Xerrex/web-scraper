Scrape https://www.edmunds.com/cars-for-sale-by-owner/ :all the Cars and their Details 

The script should be written in a way that user can input a 
zipcode which will be entered here. You may use Selenium to 
accomplish this.

user should also be allowed to input the radius which will be set here.

After going into each of the results that show up, the items 
shown in the screenshots above should be scrapped. The list of 
attributes to be scrapped is given below for your reference:
1. Name
2. Price
3. VIN Number
4. Vehicle Summary
5. Top Features & Specs

The output of the web scrapper should be fed into 
an Excel Workbook (.xlsx file) where each of these 
attributes are written in separate columns.
